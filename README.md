### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, My name is UÄŸur - aka Glang
#### I am a graduate of economics and a banker, and I also work on blockchain
Experiences and About Me : I operate highly secure, fast and stable validator nodes for many testnet blockchains.I'm using Hetzner as a server. I have been operating validator nodes since October 2021 and have gained valuable experience in these 1 year.

Security Precautions : Firewall - We reject all incoming traffic except a few important ports like 26656. Hardware, we connected SSH Key Authentication to login to server (.pem). No one can log in without these keys.

Backup : I use Zerto IT Resilience Platform for disaster recovery for cloud environments.
